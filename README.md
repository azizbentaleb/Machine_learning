## üìö Introduction

In machine learning, the quality of the data significantly impacts the performance of models. This repository emphasizes the essential steps of the machine learning workflow, including:

- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- **Data Preparation:** Transforming and normalizing data for optimal model performance.
- **Model Selection:** Choosing the right algorithms based on the problem type.
- **Feature Selection:** Identifying the most relevant features to improve model accuracy.

## üõ†Ô∏è Projects Overview :

### Project 1: Loan Approval Classification Dataset  :This dataset provides a rich basis for understanding financial risk factors and simulating predictive modeling processes for loan approval and credit scoring.
 

This dataset is a synthetic version inspired by the original Credit Risk dataset on Kaggle and enriched with additional variables based on Financial Risk for Loan Approval data. SMOTENC was used to simulate new data points to enlarge the instances. The dataset is structured for both categorical and continuous features.

Metadata : 
The dataset contains 45,000 records and 14 variables.

The dataset can be used for multiple purposes:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze key features, distribution patterns, and relationships to understand credit risk factors.
- Classification: Build predictive models to classify the loan_status variable (approved/not approved) for potential applicants.
- Regression: Develop regression models to predict the credit_score variable based on individual and loan-related attributes.


## Key Techniques
This repository covers a wide array of machine learning techniques, including but not limited to:

Data Cleaning: Imputation, outlier detection, and removal.
Data Preparation: Normalization, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
Model Selection: Comparison of algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, etc.
Feature Engineering: Techniques to create new features and optimize existing ones.
