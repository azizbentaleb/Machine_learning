## üìö Introduction

In machine learning, the quality of the data significantly impacts the performance of models. This repository emphasizes the essential steps of the machine learning workflow, including:

- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- **Data Preparation:** Transforming and normalizing data for optimal model performance.
- **Model Selection:** Choosing the right algorithms based on the problem type.
- **Feature Selection:** Identifying the most relevant features to improve model accuracy.

## üõ†Ô∏è Projects Overview :

### Project 1: Loan Approval Classification Dataset
This dataset is a synthetic version inspired by the original Credit Risk dataset on Kaggle and enriched with additional variables based on Financial Risk for Loan Approval data. SMOTENC was used to simulate new data points to enlarge the instances. The dataset is structured for both categorical and continuous features.

Metadata : 
The dataset contains 45,000 records and 14 variables, each described below:
